# Mouse Jiggler

A lightweight .NET console app that keeps your computer awake by simulating mouse movements. Built because sometimes you just need your PC to stay active without messing with power settings.

## Why This Exists

Ever been in a situation where you can't install software but need to prevent your computer from sleeping? That's exactly why I built this. No admin rights required, no installers, just a simple executable that does one thing well.

## What It Does

- Moves your mouse cursor slightly every few minutes (barely noticeable)
- Prevents Windows from going to sleep or locking the screen
- Runs invisibly in the background - no console window cluttering your screen
- Uses native Windows APIs for minimal resource usage
- Includes a simple stop script when you're done

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- .NET 10.0 Runtime (or compile it yourself)
 
 Downloadable releases generated by GitHub Actions will be available soon.
## Quick Start

### Running It

Just double-click `MouseJiggler.exe`. That's it. The app starts in the background and keeps your system awake.

### Stopping It

Double-click `stopJiggler.bat` in the same folder. The app shuts down cleanly.

## Building from Source

`git clone https://github.com/GCaringi/InvisibleJiggler.git`

`cd mouse-jiggler-dotnet`

`dotnet build -c Release`

The compiled executable will be in `bin/Release/net10.0/`

## Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` to customize behavior:

## 🔧 How It Works

The app uses Windows P/Invoke to:
1. Call `SetThreadExecutionState` to tell Windows "hey, I'm doing something important"
2. Use `SendInput` to simulate actual mouse movements (not just cursor position changes)
3. Move the cursor in a random direction, then move it back
4. Repeat every few minutes

It's designed to be undetectable by most activity monitors because it simulates real hardware input.

## Technical Details

Built with modern .NET patterns:
- `BackgroundService` for long-running operation
- Dependency injection for testability
- `LibraryImport` (source generators) instead of old `DllImport`
- Async/await throughout
- Graceful shutdown with `CancellationToken`

The whole thing uses less than 20MB of RAM and barely touches the CPU.

## Notes

- No admin rights needed
- Doesn't prevent manual sleep/shutdown
- Creates a `mousejiggler.pid` file to track the process
- Logs go to the console (or file if you configure it)
